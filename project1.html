            When I was fifteen, sixteen When I started really to play the guitar
            <br>
            I definitely wanted to become a musician
            <br>
            It was almost impossible because, it was
            <br>
            The dream was so big
            <br>
            That I didn't see any chance
            <br>
            Because I was living in a little town,<br>
            was studying
            <br>
            <br>
            And when I finally broke away from school and became a musician
            <br>
            I thought "well, now I may have a little bit of a chance"
            <br>
            Because all I really wanted to do is music
            <br>
            And not only play music, but compose music
          </p>

            At that time, in Germany, in '69, '70, they already had discotheques
            <br>
            So I would take my car, would go to a discotheque
            <br>
            Sing maybe thirty minutes
            <br>
            I think I had about seven, eight songs
            <br>
            I would partially sleep in the car
            <br>
            Because I didn't want to drive home
            <br>
            And that helped me for about almost two years to survive

          I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the fifties
          <br />
          The sounds of the sixties, of the seventies
          <br />
          And then have a sound of the future
          <br />
          And I thought: "Wait a second
          <br />
          I know the synthesizer, why don't I use the synthesizer
          <br />
          Which is the sound of the future"
          <br />
          And I didn't have any idea what to do but I knew I needed a click
          <br />
          So we put a click on the 24-track which was then synced to the Moog
          modular
          <br />
          I knew that it could be a sound of the future
          <br />
          But I didn't realize how much impact would be
